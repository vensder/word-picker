# The Word Picker

This is a simple Python application based on Tkinter, which can help you to pick the words from the foreign text which you are not learned yet.

The app is suitable for the subtitles texts of not watched movies or series yet since it hides the spoilers in the text.

You can load the subtitles file to the application, and the sorted separated words will appear on the left side of the app. After that just double-click on the words, which you are going to learn before the watching.

And they will move to the right side. After all, you can save these words to a separated file and use it for the self-learning. For example, you can use this Language Tutor Bot https://github.com/vensder/language-tutor-bot for that.
